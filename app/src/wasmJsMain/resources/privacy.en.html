            The ONI Seed Browser is hosted on servers of <strong>Hetzner Online GmbH</strong>,
            Industriestr. 25, 91710 Gunzenhausen, Germany.
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            Hetzner processes personal data on my behalf as a data processor pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR.
            A data processing agreement (DPA) has been concluded.
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>Location of processing:</strong> Data center Nuremberg, Germany.

        <div class="section-title" role="heading" aria-level="2">3. Server Operation, Technical Connection Data and IP
            Addresses
        </div>
        <p class="legal-text">
            I do not conduct independent IP tracking and do not analyze IP addresses for marketing purposes.
            At the application level, the service is configured so that IP addresses and technical connection data
            are not deliberately stored permanently.
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            Independently of this, the hosting provider (Hetzner) inevitably processes technical connection data,
            in particular IP addresses, as part of the technical operation and security of the infrastructure,
            to the extent necessary for provision, operation, error analysis and protection against attacks.
            Which specific technical log data Hetzner stores in individual cases and for how long
            depends on the systems used and the requirements of the hosting provider.
            This data is generally not provided to me.
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>Categories of processed data:</strong>
            Technical connection data (IP address, timestamp, HTTP request data, browser information).
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>Legal basis:</strong> Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR
            (legitimate interest in secure and reliable server operation and protection against misuse).
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>Obligation to provide data:</strong>
            The processing of technical connection data is mandatory for accessing the website.
            Without this data processing, the service cannot be provided.
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>Third-country transfer:</strong>
            No transfer of personal data to third countries outside the EU or EEA takes place in the context of hosting.

        </div>
        <p class="legal-text">
            The ONI Seed Browser can generally be used without registration.
            Optionally, you can log in via <strong>Steam Login</strong>.
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            For login, an external authentication service from Steam (Valve Corporation, USA) is used.
            Communication takes place between your device and Steam.
            I only receive your <strong>SteamID</strong>.
            No other Steam profile information (e.g., username, avatar, or friends list) is retrieved from Steam.
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>Categories of processed data:</strong>
            Online identifiers (SteamID, cryptographic hash of the SteamID).
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>Recipients:</strong>
            During login, data is transmitted to Steam or Valve Corporation (USA).
            I subsequently process the SteamID received from Steam to perform the login
            and for the functions described below.
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>Third-country transfer:</strong>
            As part of Steam authentication, data is transferred to Valve Corporation, USA.
            Valve has committed to complying with EU Standard Contractual Clauses.
            For more information, please refer to Steam's privacy policy:
            <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/privacy_agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

            </a>
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            For technical authentication, a <strong>JWT (JSON Web Token)</strong> is generated,
            which contains the SteamID and a cryptographic hash of this ID.
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            To remain logged in, this JWT can be stored locally in the browser
            (see section "Storage of Settings and Login Status (localStorage)").
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>Purpose:</strong>
            Authentication, abuse prevention, and assignment of contributions and requests.
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>Legal basis:</strong>
            Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR (provision of the optional login function)
            and Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (abuse prevention).
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>Obligation to provide data:</strong>
            Login via Steam is voluntary. Without login, you can use the service in read-only mode,
            but cannot upload Seeds/Maps or submit requests.
        </p>

        <div class="section-title" role="heading" aria-level="2">5. Seeds/Maps, Mod Uploads, Requests and Leaderboard
        </div>

        <p class="legal-text">
            Users can submit Seeds/Maps to the service's API via a mod for the game <em>Oxygen Not Included</em>.
            A valid Steam auth token (JWT) is required for this.
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            Additionally, logged-in users can request Seeds/Maps to be added to the database (requests),
            and optionally set a name for a leaderboard.
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            The following information is processed in the database:
        </p>

        <ul class="legal-list">
            <li>the submitted Seed or Map data structure (contribution data)</li>
            <li>an assignment to the SteamID of the contributing user (for abuse prevention and traceability)</li>
            <li>if voluntarily provided: a name set by the user for the leaderboard</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>Categories of processed data:</strong>
            Online identifiers (SteamID, cryptographic hash), game data (Seeds/Maps), optional user inputs (leaderboard
            name).
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>Leaderboard:</strong>
            The leaderboard shows which user has contributed how many Seeds/Maps.
            A public association with a person is only possible if a user voluntarily provides a name for the
            leaderboard.
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>Public delivery:</strong>
            Seeds/Maps are delivered publicly.
            <strong>Not the SteamID itself</strong> is used, but exclusively a <strong>hash of the SteamID</strong>,
            so that no direct assignment to a person is possible.
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>Retention period:</strong>
        </p>

        <ul class="legal-list">
            <li>
                For requested Seeds/Maps (requests), the SteamID is deleted from the database
                once the requested Seed or Map has been successfully created or added.
            </li>
            <li>
                For Seeds/Maps submitted via the mod, the SteamID remains stored together with the respective
                contribution
                for the duration of its existence. No automatic deletion takes place.
                Upon request of the contributor, a specific contribution (Seed/Map) can be deleted.
                The deletion removes the assignment of this contribution to the SteamID.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>Legal basis:</strong>

        <p class="legal-text">
            The ONI Seed Browser stores certain data locally in the browser (localStorage).

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>a) Search filters and markers</strong><br/>
            Users can save search filters and mark coordinates.

        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>b) Login status (JWT)</strong><br/>
            When you log in via Steam, the generated authentication token (JWT)
            is stored locally in the browser so that you remain logged in and can use the corresponding functions.
            The JWT is not automatically time-limited. A dedicated logout function is not implemented.
            To end your login session, delete the website data in your browser (clear localStorage).
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            The JWT is transmitted to my server during authenticated API requests

            <strong>Retention period:</strong><br/>
            The data stored in localStorage remains there until you delete it yourself in the browser.
