            The ONI Seed Browser is hosted on servers of <strong>Hetzner Online GmbH</strong>,
            Industriestr. 25, 91710 Gunzenhausen, Germany.
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            Hetzner processes personal data on my behalf as a data processor pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR.
            A data processing agreement (DPA) has been concluded.

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>Location of processing:</strong> Data center Nuremberg, Germany.

            IP Addresses
        </div>
        <p class="legal-text">
            I do not conduct independent IP tracking and do not analyze IP addresses for marketing purposes.
            At the application level, the service is configured so that IP addresses and technical connection data
            are not deliberately stored permanently.
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            Independently of this, the hosting provider (Hetzner) inevitably processes technical connection data,
            in particular IP addresses, as part of the technical operation and security of the infrastructure,
            to the extent necessary for provision, operation, error analysis and protection against attacks.
            Which specific technical log data Hetzner stores in individual cases and for how long
            depends on the systems used and the specifications of the hosting provider.
            This data is generally not provided to me.
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>Categories of data processed:</strong>
            Technical connection data (IP address, timestamp, HTTP request data, browser information).

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>Legal basis:</strong> Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>Obligation to provide:</strong>
            The processing of technical connection data is mandatory for accessing the website.
            Without this data processing, the service cannot be provided.

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>Third country transfer:</strong>
            No transfer of personal data to third countries outside the EU or EEA takes place as part of hosting.

        <div class="section-title" role="heading" aria-level="2">4. Steam Login (Optional) and Third-Party Services</div>
        <p class="legal-text">
            The ONI Seed Browser can generally be used without logging in.
            Optionally, you can log in via <strong>Steam Login</strong>.
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            An external authentication service from Steam (Valve Corporation, USA) is used for login.
            Communication takes place between your device and Steam.
            I only receive your <strong>Steam ID</strong>.
            No further Steam profile information (e.g., username, avatar, or friends list) is retrieved from Steam.
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            No separate user account is created with this service.
            Authentication is performed exclusively via Steam, and all data is directly linked to your Steam ID.
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>Categories of data processed:</strong>
            Online identifiers (Steam ID, cryptographic hash of Steam ID).
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>Recipients:</strong>
            As part of the login process, data is transmitted to Steam or Valve Corporation (USA).
            I subsequently process the Steam ID received from Steam to perform the login
            and for the functions described below.
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>Third country transfer:</strong>
            As part of Steam authentication, data is transferred to Valve Corporation, USA.
            Valve has committed to complying with EU standard contractual clauses.
            Further information can be found in Steam's privacy policy:
            <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/privacy_agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                https://store.steampowered.com/privacy_agreement/
            </a>
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            For technical authentication, a <strong>JWT (JSON Web Token)</strong> is generated,
            which contains the Steam ID and a cryptographic hash of this ID.
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            To remain logged in, this JWT can be stored locally in the browser
            (see section "Storage of Settings and Login Status (localStorage)").
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>Purpose:</strong>
            Authentication, abuse prevention, and assignment of contributions and requests.
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>Legal basis:</strong>
            Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR (consent) and
            Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (abuse prevention).
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>Withdrawal of consent:</strong>
            You can withdraw your consent at any time by deleting the
            website data (localStorage) in your browser.
            Withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of processing
            carried out before the withdrawal.
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>Obligation to provide:</strong>
            Login via Steam is voluntary. Without logging in, you can use the service in read-only mode,
            but you cannot upload Seeds/Maps or make requests.
        </p>

        <div class="section-title" role="heading" aria-level="2">5. Seeds/Maps, Mod Uploads, Requests and Leaderboard
        </div>

        <p class="legal-text">
            Users can submit Seeds/Maps to the service API via a mod for the game <em>Oxygen Not Included</em>.
            A valid Steam auth token (JWT) is required for this.
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            Additionally, logged-in users can request Seeds/Maps to be added to the database (requests),
            and optionally set a name for a leaderboard.
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            The following information is processed in the database:
        </p>

        <ul class="legal-list">
            <li>The submitted seed or map data structure (contribution data)</li>
            <li>An assignment to the Steam ID of the contributing user (for abuse prevention and
                traceability)
            </li>
            <li>If voluntarily provided: a user-defined name for the leaderboard</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>Categories of data processed:</strong>
            Online identifiers (Steam ID, cryptographic hash), game data (Seeds/Maps), optional user input
            (leaderboard name).
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>Leaderboard:</strong>
            The leaderboard shows which user has contributed how many Seeds/Maps.
            Public assignment to a person is only possible if a user voluntarily provides a name for the
            leaderboard.
            You can remove yourself from the leaderboard at any time by entering an empty name.
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>Public delivery:</strong>
            Seeds/Maps are delivered publicly.
            <strong>Not the Steam ID itself</strong>, but exclusively a <strong>hash of the
            Steam ID</strong> is used,
            so that no direct assignment to a person is possible.
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>Storage duration:</strong>
        </p>

        <ul class="legal-list">
            <li>
                For requested Seeds/Maps (requests), the Steam ID is deleted from the database
                once the requested seed or map has been successfully generated or added.
            </li>
            <li>
                For Seeds/Maps submitted via the mod, the Steam ID remains stored together with
                the respective contribution for the duration of its existence. No automatic deletion occurs.
                Upon request of the contributor, a specific contribution (Seed/Map) can be deleted.
                The deletion removes the assignment of this contribution to the Steam ID.
            </li>
            <li>
                Since no separate user account is created, there is no central "account deletion".
                Deletion occurs on a contribution-by-contribution basis upon request (see section "Your Rights").
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>Legal basis:</strong>
            Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR (consent for authenticated uploads) and
            Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (abuse prevention, system integrity, traceability of contributions).

        <div class="section-title" role="heading" aria-level="2">6. Storage of Settings and Login Status
            (localStorage)
        </div>

        <p class="legal-text">
            The ONI Seed Browser stores certain data locally in the browser (localStorage).
            This storage occurs exclusively on your device.
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>a) Search filters and markers</strong><br/>
            Users can save search filters and mark coordinates.
            This information is stored exclusively locally and is not transmitted to the server.
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>b) Login status (JWT)</strong><br/>
            When you log in via Steam, the generated authentication token (JWT)
            is stored locally in the browser so that you remain logged in and can use the corresponding functions.
            The JWT does not have an automatic time limit. No dedicated logout function is implemented.
            To end your login session, delete the website data in your browser (delete localStorage).
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            The JWT is transmitted to my server during authenticated API requests
            to assign your Steam ID and provide the desired functions.
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>Storage duration:</strong><br/>
            Data stored in localStorage remains there until you delete it yourself in the browser.
        </p>

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>Legal basis (device storage):</strong><br/>
            § 25(2) No. 2 TTDSG (technically necessary storage/access to provide a function requested by the user).

            You can withdraw your consent to Steam login at any time
            by deleting the website data (localStorage) in your browser.
            Withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of processing carried out before the withdrawal.

            However, if you object to the processing of technical connection data, the service can no longer

        <p class="legal-text">
            <strong>Deletion of contributions:</strong>
            Since no separate user account is created, deletion of your data occurs on a contribution-by-contribution basis.
            You can request the deletion of individual Seeds/Maps submitted by you at any time.
